# Consent Observatory
We created the Consent Observatory to make it easier for more people to study consent services on the web.

Consent pop-ups have become ubiquitous on the web as companies whose business models rely on personal data processing try to grapple with data protection regulation across the world. Researchers, regulators, and policy makers have become interested in understanding whether those consent pop-us actually comply with the regulation, how they evolve over time, what geographic differences are, etc. However, studying consent pop-ups at scale requires extensive computational infrastructure and domain expertise, and this complexity is currently a barrier for many people. By making our data gathering tools public, we hope to make it easier for more people to study this topic and to prevent unnecessary and time-consuming duplication of software.

This software was used to generate the results in the research paper [A Cross-Country Analysis of GDPR Cookie Banners and Flexible Methods for Scraping Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19655).

## Installation
* Clone this repository
* `cd`to the project root and run `npm install`
* Configure the required `env` variables described below
* For development run `npm run dev` for production run `npm run build` and then run the server application 
  using node `build/index.js` (use e.g. `pm2` for running the server in production, see below example)

### Env Variables
For development create a `.env` file in the root of the project or set them using the host environment. 
For the production build the variables must be set in the host environment. See the .

- `JOBS_ROOT_DIR` **[required]** where should pending, running and finished jobs be stored?
- `RULES_DIR` **[required]** where are the rules files located for the `web-extractor`? The directory `rules` has the scripts used for the research paper.
- `MAIL_SMTP_HOST` **[required]** SMTP-server hostname (e.g. `smtp.example.com`)
- `MAIL_SMTP_PORT` **[required]** SMTP-server port (e.g. 25 or 587)
- `MAIL_MESSAGE_FROM` **[required]** the email to set as the `from` field (e.g. `info@example.com` or `"John Doe" <info@example.com>`)
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_SECRET` **[required]** admin key for accessing /admin/status must a least be 8 characters long
- `JOBS_COMPLETED_EXPIRATION_TIME_MS [default=604800000]` how long should completed jobs (and their data) be kept?
- `USER_DEFAULT_MAX_URLS [default=1000]` How many urls can a regular user submit for analysis?
- `USER_DEFAULT_MAX_JOBS [default=1]` How many jobs can a regular user have registered?
- `USER_WHITELIST_MAX_URLS [default=10000]` How many urls can a whitelisted user submit for analysis?
- `USER_WHITELIST_MAX_JOBS [default=1]` How many jobs can a whitelisted user have registered?
- `USER_EMAIL_WHITELIST_FILE_PATH [default=]` The path for a newline delimited list of whitelisted user emails
- `MAIL_SMTP_USER` SMTP-server username (most likely the email address or none of server is whitelisted on ip-address)
- `MAIL_SMTP_PASS` SMTP-server password (most likely password for the email address or none of server is whitelisted on ip-address)
- `MAIL_SMTP_DISABLE_VERIFICATION [default=false]` set to `true` disable the verification check when server starts, disable this during development for faster restart times 
- `MAIL_DISABLED [default=false]` set to `true` disable sending emails
- `PORT [default=3000]` (only used for production) the port the server should use
- `ORIGIN` (only used for production) the host name the server is running on, e.g. https://my.example

### Server Setup With PM2 for Production
The following is a full guide for installing and running the project on an linux (ubuntu) server. The example 
will run most commands ass a system user called `apps` (instructions below), so multiple users are able to start/stop/deploy the
app and so the app is not running as `root`.

#### Requirements
* git is installed
* node.js >= 16.x is installed

#### PM2 and Project Setup
* install pm2 `sudo npm install pm2@latest -g`
* create a user "apps" for running our app `sudo adduser --system --shell /bin/bash --group apps`
* create a startup script for pm2 to run as the "apps" user `sudo -u apps pm2 startup` copy the generated line and run it
* create a directory for the installation and pm2 scripts `sudo mkdir /apps && sudo chown apps:apps /apps && sudo chmod o-rwx /apps`
* switch to the "apps" user `sudo su apps`
* clone the git repo `git clone https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/consent-observatory.eu.git`
  * To update the existing git repo use `cd /apps/consent-observatory.eu` and run `git pull origin master`
* create a directory for the pm2 scripts `mkdir -p /apps/run-scripts/consent-observatory.eu`
* copy the pm2 scripts and make them executable `cp /apps/consent-observatory.eu/server-scripts/pm2/* /apps/run-scripts/consent-observatory.eu/`
* make the scripts executable `cd /apps/run-scripts/consent-observatory.eu && chmod ug+x start.sh stop.sh build.sh deploy.sh`
* create data dirs e.g. `mkdir -p /apps/consent-obs-data/rules && -p /apps/consent-obs-data/jobs`
* edit the `env.sh` file and add the missing values (and change paths if required)
* add one or more rulesets to the rules dir created above see below documentation for how to create a ruleset
* build the project `/apps/run-scripts/consent-observatory.eu/build.sh`

#### Puppeteer Dependencies and Sandbox
> **NOTE** this is only required if you are running on a server installation without a GUI.

* install ui libs and other dependencies `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator3-1 libasound2 \
  libatk-bridge2.0-0 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 \
  libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgbm1 libgcc1 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libnss3 libpango-1.0-0 \
  libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 \
  libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 lsb-release wget xdg-utils`
* install chrome sandbox
  * navigate to puppeteer local chromium dir `cd /apps/consent-observatory.eu/node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium`
  * find linux-revision `ls -l` and navigate to `cd linux-[REVISION]/chrome-linux`
  * copy the sandbox to `sudo cp chrome_sandbox /usr/local/sbin/chrome-devel-sandbox`
  * change the owner of the sandbox `sudo chown root:root /usr/local/sbin/chrome-devel-sandbox`
  * change the permissions of the sandbox `sudo chmod 4755 /usr/local/sbin/chrome-devel-sandbox`
  * The path of the sandbox is exported from `env.sh` file described in the [PM2 and Project Setup](#pm2-and-project-setup) section. Change this is you change the path.

See also [sandbox setup](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#alternative-setup-setuid-sandbox) and
[headless linux](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#alternative-setup-setuid-sandbox) for more details.

#### Apache2 Setup (Optional)
Used for reverse proxying to the application. If another reverse proxy is used this step is not required.

* add the latest version of apache2 to the apt-repository `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/apache2 -y && sudo apt update`
* install apace2 `sudo apt install apache2 -y`
* install extra modules `sudo a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel rewrite && sudo systemctl reload apache2`
* copy virtual host file to apache2 sites lib `sudo cp /apps/consent-observatory.eu/server-scripts/apache2/consent-observatory.eu.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/`
  * Default the virtual host is set to point to port `3000`, if the app is configured to something edit the `app-port` variable in `sudo nano /etc/apace2/sites-available/apache2/consent-observatory.eu.conf`
* enable the virtual host `sudo a2ensite consent-observatory.eu && sudo systemctl reload apache2`

#### Usage
> **NOTE** All commands should be run as the "apps" user unless explicitly stated

* change to the "apps" user `sudo su apps`
* navigate to the "run-scripts" dir `cd /apps/run-scripts/consent-observatory.eu`
* start and stop the application using `./start.sh` and `./stop.sh`
* After and update of the project (from git) use `./deploy.sh` (which will run `stop.sh`, `build.sh` and `start.sh`)

## Configuring Rules (Rulesets)
Rules are defined in rulesets which is one or more rule-files as described in the [Web-Extractor documentation](https://github.com/centre-for-humanities-computing/web-extractor)
and a `__ui.json` file. Rulesets can be defined in `RULES_DIR` directory as well as direct subdirectories of the `RULES_DIR`directory. 
At least one ruleset must be present for the application to start.

> **NOTE** to import the modules correctly it is important to have the `package.json` file at root of the rules dir with at least `{ "type": "module" }` defined.

**Example Structure**
```shell
/example/path/rules
├─ __ui.json
├─ general-rule1.js
├─ general-rule2.js
├─ denmark
   ├─ _ui.json
   ├─ dk-rule.js
├─ germany
   ├─ __ui.json
   ├─ germany-rule.js
├─ package.json       
```

### __ui.json
The `__ui.json` files has the following structure and is used for configuring the user-interface for the given ruleset and define which
options should be passed to the `init()` method of the rules in the ruleset making it possible to have different options for each ruleset.

```json5
{
  "name": "Extract Text", // [REQUIRED] name shown in ui, this must be unique
  "description": "A general rule for extraction headings and paragraphs", // [REQUIRED] description shown in the ui, what is the ruleset typically used for
  "sortKey": 1, // a number to compare this ruleset to other rulesets, if not defined the name will be used for sorting
  "options": [ // an optional set of option objects
    {
      "type": "checkbox", // [REQUIRED]
      "key": "includeParagraph", // [REQUIRED] the key will be used as property in the options object
      "label": "Include paragraphs in the result", // [REQUIRED] the label of the checkbox 
      "description": "If selected paragraphs will be extracted" // an optional description which will be shown below the checkbox in the ui
    },
    { // another checkbox, same rules as above apply
      "type": "checkbox",
      "key": "includeHeadings",
      "label": "Include headings in the result",
      "description": "If selected headings (h1-h6) will be extracted"
    },
    {
      "type": "radio", // [REQUIRED] 
      "key": "extractType", // [REQUIRED] the key will be used as property in the options object
      "title": "Extraction Type", // an optional title to show above the radio buttons
      "description": "What should be included in the result?", // an optional description which will be shown below the radio buttons in the ui
      "options": [ // [REQUIRED] at least one radio button must be present
        {
          "label": "Only Text", // [REQUIRED] the label of the radio button
          "value": "textOnly" // [REQUIRED] the value so set for the "key" in the options object if this radio button is selected
        },
        {
          "label": "Text and HTML", // [REQUIRED] the label of the radio button
          "value": "textAndHTML" // [REQUIRED] the value so set for the "key" in the options object if this radio button is selected
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Option Sections
Options can be divided into sections with ther own title and sections can include other sections to create nested structures.

```json5
{
  "name": "Some Name",
  "description": "Some desc...",
  "options": [
    { // options defined here will be at the root level
      "type": "checkbox",
      "key": "someKey",
      "label": "someLabel",
    },
    { // create a section with its own title and options
      "type": "section", // [REQUIRED]
      "title": "Extract the Following Element Types", // [REQUIRED] the title of the section
      "options": [
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "includeH1",
          "label": "H1"
        },
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "includeH2",
          "label": "H2"
        },
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "includeH3",
          "label": "H3"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rule Init Options
The `init()` method (if defined) will for each rule, before extraction, be called with an object in the following format, where the `ruleset` property
will correspond the chosen ruleset and options for the ruleset selected by the user.

```js
{
  destDir: "/some/path", // the path where the result will be stored, can be used to include additional data
  ruleset: {
    name: "name-of-ruleset", // the name of the chosen ruleset
    options: { // the options defined in __ui.json file for this ruleset and the values selected by the user
      key1: "someValue",
      key2: "someValue"
    }
  }
}
```

### Ruleset Example

The following ruleset will make it possible to choose which text content to extract and what format should be included in the output in the output.


**__ui.json**

```json5
{
  "name": "Text Content",
  "description": "Use this rule for extracting text elements",
  "options": [
    {
      "type": "radio",
      "key": "extractScope",
      "title": "What should be extracted?",
      "options": [
        {
          "label": "Text",
          "value": "text"
        },
        {
          "label": "HTML",
          "value": "html"
        },
        {
          "label": "Text and HTML",
          "value": "textAndHTML"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "title": "Elements to Extract",
      "options": [
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "extractParagraphs",
          "label": "Extract Paragraphs",
          "description": "Extract all p-elements"
        },
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "extractH1",
          "label": "Extract H1",
          "description": "Extract all h1-elements"
        },
        {
          "type": "checkbox",
          "key": "extractH2",
          "label": "Extract H2",
          "description": "Extract all h2-elements"
        },
        // ... etc ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**text-content-rule.js**
```js
export default {
    init(options) {
        this.options = options;
    },
    extractorOptions() {
        return this.options;
    },
    extractor: {
        extract(template = {}, url, options) {
            const rulesetOptions = options.ruleset.options;
            function saveData(key, elements) {
                elements = [...elements]; // turn into an array of elements, so we can use array methods
                let result = {};
                if (rulesetOptions.extractScope.includes('text')) {
                    result.text = elements.map(element => element.textContent);
                }
                if (rulesetOptions.extractScope.includes('HTML')) {
                    result.HTML = elements.map(element => element.outerHTML);
                }
                template[key] = result;
            }
            if (rulesetOptions.extractParagraphs) {
                saveData('p', document.querySelectorAll('p'));
            }
            for (let x = 1; x <= 6; x++) {
                if (rulesetOptions[`extractH${x}`]) {
                    saveData(`h${x}`, document.querySelectorAll(`h${x}`));
                }
            }
            return template;
        }
    }
};
```
**package.json**

*this only needs to be present at root of the rules dir*
```json5
{
  "type": "module"
}
```
